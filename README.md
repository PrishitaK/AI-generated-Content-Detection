# AI-generated-Content-Detection

This project is focused on distinguishing AI-generated text from human-written content. It has been built with an intuitive Streamlit interface, deigned for users to easily analyze texts in real-time and identify potential AI-generated content.

I have made use of a feature based approach in order to detect AI-generated content. This approach uses the fact that there exist consistently recognizible and known differences in all texts generated by an LLM and human text. 

I have made use of Perplexity and Burstiness as the measures to identify AI-generated content.

## Perplexity
It is a measure of how well a probability model predicts the next word in a sequence of words. It quantifies the uncertainty if a language model by calculating the likelihood of the model producing a given text.

*Lower perplexity --> model is more confident or is less surprised --> likely to be AI generated*
*Higher perplexity --> human written content*

## Burstiness
It refers to the tendency of certain words to appear in clusters or *'burts'* rather than being evenly distributed throughout a document. AI generated text can potentially have more predictability (less burstiness) since AI models tend to re-use certain words or phrases more often than a human would. 
*Higher Burstiness --> Human written content*
*Lower Burstiness --> likely to be AI-generated*
